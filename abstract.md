Abstract

As CO2 emissions increase, global temperature increase is the most commonly 
referred metric for the amount of damage humans have incurred on the environment.
Media brings up frequently how higher temperature is leading to icebergs melting 
and the sea level rising, as this will displace many people in areas close to the
ocean. What gets completely ignored is the increasing volatility of winds. As wind
is fully dependent on heat escaping from the ground, higher temperatures will
lead to stronger winds in the future, levels that we may have never anticipated and
prepared for in terms of building our infrastructure and homes. The goal of this
paper is to show how wind speed volatility is changing, its forecasted change, and
the potential for displacing people in communities that will have higher wind
volatility in the future.
