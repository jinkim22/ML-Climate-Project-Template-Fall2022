Week 3

Wind
 global winds caused from differences in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth.

The two main causes of large-scale [atmospheric circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation)qnd the rotation of the planet ([Coriolis effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect)
).

- Winds have various aspects:
    - [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity) ([wind speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed))
    - Density of the gas involved
    - energy content, or [wind energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_energy)
- Indirect effects
    - wildfires
    - dispersing seeds
    - flying insects / bird population
    - bad for livestock if it’s cold wind
        - when wind is > 25 mph, hair and wool are ineffective so they die
    - animal behavior
- There’s different types of winds the higher up you go in the atmostphere. maybe this will effect air travel?
- measured by anemometers or propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire

Week 4
Found dataset for general weather of regions (wind , temperature, etc.), and CO2 Levels in the atmosphere.
Both are daily measurements from 1/1/1980.
Need to figure out how I want to define "wind volatiilty." Is it variation within the day? number of sudden gusts? what is it?
I think I'm leaning more towards number of sudden gusts if that data is predictable, OR I can talk about how the max wind speed
for a certain day is becoming increasingly faster. Average is definitely increasing from the quick data analysis I did in my
Jupyter notebook, but also, the number of days where there were strong winds (>40mph) is increasing.

I also spend this week thinking about what wind is strong wind. Though building codes universally is supposed to withstand
~100-120mph gusts, I want to define strong, inconvenient winds to be > 40mph as this can cause small structural damage and
make it difficult for humans to be outside.

Remaining task: Find more variables / features that relate to wind speeds. CO2 emission is (unsurprisingly) not a good
indicator for how fast the winds will be for a given day. They do correlate somewhat with max temperature, and precipitation
so there may need to be some work done in making a causal effect framework.
