Week 3

Wind
 global winds caused from differences in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth.

The two main causes of large-scale [atmospheric circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation)
 are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet ([Coriolis effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect)
).

- Winds have various aspects:
    - [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity) ([wind speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed))
    - Density of the gas involved
    - energy content, or [wind energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_energy)
- Indirect effects
    - wildfires
    - dispersing seeds
    - flying insects / bird population
    - bad for livestock if it’s cold wind
        - when wind is > 25 mph, hair and wool are ineffective so they die
    - animal behavior
- There’s different types of winds the higher up you go in the atmostphere. maybe this will effect air travel?
- measured by anemometers or propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire
